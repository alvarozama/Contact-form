## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

More than anything, this project allowed me to reinforce some of the concepts previously covered regarding validation of forms while also allowing me to understand how to implement accessibility measures and why they are important.

### Continued development

I'd like to keep exploring better, more efficient ways to validate forms.
